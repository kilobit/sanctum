# Sanctum #

Inspired by the well protected and secluded study of a particular
comic book and movie Super Hero, The **Sanctum** project attempts to
provide a digital space for your personal projects, documents and
thoughts.

## What the Sanctum Project is *NOT* ##

Government agencies, nefarious organizations of secret villains and
nosy system administrators will find reality bending ways around these
protections.  If this is an issue, the user is advised to administer
their own system, fly under the radar and bulk purchase some black
robes.

Security features that **Sanctum** will attempt to provide include:

* Strong encryption at rest
* Monitoring for filesystem access by unauthorized processes
* Automatic encryption of data in the event of attempted access
* An overlay filesystem so unencrypted data never touches the disk
* Change history
* Assisted document management

If you are looking for any of these features, you won't find them at
the moment as they haven't been implemented yet.

Stay tuned.
